# Common data structures for JavaScript

This is an implementation of some of the most common data structures in JavaScript.

The provided data structures are:
- A tree set (an ordered set)
- A binary and a binomial heap, to be used as a priority queue
- A hash set (note that JavaScript already provides the Set class)
- A linked list (as well as a doubly linked list)
- A queue (based on an array)
- A graph (currently, the graph only supports topological sort and the SCC algorithm)
